# Luminskin-Products App

This mini E-commerce App was built with Reactjs, Graphql, Apollo-client, Apollo/react-hooks for state management and styled with styled-components...
The was was built as a test project for a job application to showcase my understanding of Reactjs, graphql and apollo-client and to
effectively test my knowledge of state management across different components and pages.
